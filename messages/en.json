      },
      "1": {
        "question": "What is an ADU and how can it benefit my property?",
        "answer": "An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a separate and independent living space located on the same lot as a main residence. ADUs offer numerous benefits, such as increasing property value, generating rental income, and creating a private space for family or guests. They also contribute to housing solutions in urban areas by maximizing efficient land use."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What are the requirements to build an ADU on my property?",
        "answer": "Requirements vary by city and county but generally include zoning regulations, minimum/maximum unit size, setbacks from property boundaries, and utility connections. In California, state laws have made it easier to build ADUs by reducing parking restrictions and allowing them even in single-family residential zones."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "How does the permitting process work?",
        "answer": "The process includes site evaluation, architectural planning, engineering reviews, and municipal approvals. We first assess the property to determine its feasibility according to zoning laws and building codes. Then we prepare detailed plans that meet regulatory requirements. Once finalized, we submit them to the city for review and approval."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Do you offer financing for construction and remodeling?",
        "answer": "Yes, we help homeowners find suitable financing options, which may include home equity loans, construction loans, government grants, and specialized ADU financing programs. Some cities offer incentives for building ADUs, such as reduced fees or streamlined approval processes."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "How long does a remodel or new construction take?",
        "answer": "The timeline depends on the complexity and scope of the project. A complete ADU build typically takes 4 to 6 months from design to completion. Interior remodels or backyard improvements can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "What types of designs and visualizations do you provide?",
        "answer": "We provide complete visualizations including conceptual sketches, 2D architectural plans, and detailed 3D renders showing what the final structure will look like. We also offer virtual tours that allow you to 'walk' through the future space using digital simulations."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "Can you help me maximize my property’s value?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Our team specializes in identifying strategic improvements that enhance both functionality and property value. Whether through ADU construction, backyard transformations, or interior renovations, we provide expert recommendations tailored to your lot’s potential."
      },
